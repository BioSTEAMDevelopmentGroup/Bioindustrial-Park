All units are explicitly defined here for transparency and easy reference.
Naming conventions:
    D = Distillation column
    AC = Adsorption column
    F = Flash tank or multiple-effect evaporator
    H = Heat exchange
    M = Mixer
    P = Pump (including conveying belt)
    R = Reactor
    S = Splitter (including solid/liquid separator)
    T = Tank or bin for storage
    U = Other units
Processes:
    100: Feedstock preprocessing
    200: Pretreatment
    300: Conversion
    400: Separation
    500: Wastewater treatment
    600: Storage
    700: Co-heat and power
    800: Cooling utility generation
    900: Miscellaneous facilities
    1000: Heat exchanger network
