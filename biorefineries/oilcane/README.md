# oilcane: Oilcane Biorefineries and Benchmarks

This module contains oilcane biorefinery configurations and "benchmark" 
sugarcane biorefinery configurations, as discussed in [[1]](#1). Two configurations
are currently available: (I) oil extraction by the expression of 
bagasse and centrifugation of vinasse from juice fermentation, and (II) oil 
extraction after an integrated, single-step co-fermentation of both juice 
and bagasse hydrolysate. In contrast to the `biorefineries.lipidcane` module,
mass balances around oil separation are based on experimental results and
the oil composition in terms of free fatty acids, triacyl glycerides, and polar lipids 
is accounted for. Note that the name "oilcane" is prefered 
over lipid-cane, as it resonates better with a non-scientific audience and is more
consistent with how we talk about vegetable oils.

All configurations share the same feedstock handling, juicing, and biodiesel 
production systems. In the juicing system, the oilcane is crushed, the juice 
is treated and filtered to remove impurities, and the bagasse is conveyed out 
at a moisture content of 50%. The bagasse is assumed to retain 40-70% of the 
total oil present in oilcane. In the biodiesel production area, the oil is first
pretreated to remove polar lipids and convert any free fatty acids (FFAs) to 
acyl glycerides via glycerolysis.15â€“17 Once pretreated, the oil is trans-esterified 
with excess methanol and sodium methoxide catalyst to produce biodiesel and glycerol.
The biodiesel is centrifuged out, washed, and vacuum dried. The glycerol is distilled 
to 80 wt % and sold as crude glycerol. 

The conventional configuration can be divided into nine areas: feedstock handling,
juicing, ethanol production, oil extraction, biodiesel production, combined 
heat and power, utilities, heat exchanger network (HXN), and storage (Figure 1). 
The oil-rich bagasse is pelleted to reduce the moisture content and volume to 
extract 50 to 70% of the oil by screw pressing (Area 400). Then, the bagasse is
burned to produce steam and electricity for the plant (Area 600), with excess
electricity sold to the grid. The juice is fermented and distilled (Area 300).
The vinasse is also sent to the oil extraction area (Area 400), where it is 
concentrated by evaporation then centrifuged to extract the oil. The utility 
area includes on-site recirculation of cooling water and chilled water (Area 700).

Two sugarcane biorefinery configurations were also modeled to compare the economic 
benefit of processing oil-producing feedstocks. The conventional and cellulosic
ethanol sugarcane biorefineries are non-oil processing counterparts to the 
conventional and cellulosic configurations of the oilcane biorefineries, 
respectively, and follow the same assumptions and overall configurations with 
the exception of no oil extraction or biodiesel production areas (Figure S1).

Integrated oilsorghum processing is also implemented in this module using
BioSTEAM's agile system simulation features. Because oilsorghum can be 
harvested for 2 months when oilcane is not in season, an idle oilcane 
biorefinery could potentially increase biofuel production by processing 
oilsorghum.

Getting Started
---------------

Four biorefineries can be loaded using the names detailed in the following table.

|           |                         | Conventional | Cellulosic |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Oilcane   | Single feedstock        | O1           | O2         |
|           | With sorghum processing | O1\*         | O2\*       |
| Sugarcane | Single feedstock        | S1           | S2         |
|           | With sorghum processing | S1\*         | S2\*       |

Here are a few examples:

```python
>>> import biorefineries.oilcane as oc
>>> oc.load('S1') # Load conventional sugarcane system
>>> oc.sys.show(data=False) # Full system
System: sugarcane_sys
ins...
[0] sugarcane

>>> oc.load('O1') # Load conventional oilcane system
>>> oc.sys.show(data=False)
System: oilcane_sys
ins...
[0] oilcane
outs...

```

To retrieve economic and environmental results at different scenarios, you can 
use the Model object:

```python
>>> import biorefineries.oilcane as oc
>>> oc.load('O2') # Load cellulosic oilcane system
>>> parameters = oc.model.get_baseline_sample() # All parameters at the baseline scenario
>>> parameters
