Oxalic: Production of Oxalic Acid from Sugarcane
=======================================================================================

This biorefinery is developed for Lu, et.al. [1]_ for the production of 
oxalic acid from sugarcane. It includes juicing, fermentation, 
and separation processes. Part of the script is adopted from [2]_, [3]_, and [4]_.

Installation
------------
In an environment with Python v3.9.21, do the following:
    (1) Clone this repository (this may require a few minutes' time; git clone https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/Bioindustrial-Park)
    (2) Add /Bioindustrial-Park/biorefineries to your Python paths
    (3) Install the following packages in sequence (this may require a few minutes' time):
	    (i) biosteam==2.46.0
	    (ii) thermosteam==0.44.0
	    (iii) contourplots==0.3.4
	    (iv) numpy==1.26.4

Getting started
---------------
Simply import the biorefinery.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from biorefineries import oxalic
    >>> oxalic.load()
    >>> # Once loaded, you can have a quick glance of the results
    >>> # Note that the first simulation will take a longer time
    >>> oxalic.simulate_and_print()
    
    ---------- Simulation Results ----------
    MPSP is $2.41/kg AA
    GWP-100a is -2.320 kg CO2-eq/kg AA
    FEC is -55.057 MJ/kg AA
    GWP-100a without electricity credit is 3.863 kg CO2-eq/kg AA
    FEC without electricity credit is 21.270 MJ/kg AA

Systems
-------
The `Flowsheet`, `System`, and `TEA`, objects are `flowsheet`, `system`, and `succinic_tea`, respectively.

Naming conventions:
    D = Distillation column

    E = Evaporator
    
    F = Flash tank

    H = Heat exchange

    M = Mixer

    P = Pump (including conveying belt)

    R = Reactor

    S = Splitter (including solid/liquid and liquid/liquid separator)

    T = Tank or bin for storage

    U = Other units

    PS = Process specificiation, not physical units, but for adjusting streams

Processes:
    100: Preprocessing

    200: Juicing

    300: Fermentation

    400: Separation

    500: Wastewater

    600-900: Facilities

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # You can directly access the Flowsheet, System, and TEA objects
    >>> oxalic.load()
    >>> oxalic.simulate_and_print()
    >>> oxalic.flowsheet
    <Flowsheet: oxalic>
    >>> oxalic.system
    System: oxalic_sys
    Highest convergence error among components in recycle
    stream P203-0 after 1 loops:
    - flow rate   2.54e-02 kmol/hr (6.6e-05%)
    - temperature 1.90e-09 K (5.1e-10%)
    

Analyses
--------
Multiple analysis modules were used to evaluate biorefineries for [1]_, including
full Monte Carlo simulation (oxalic.run_uncertainty_analysis)
and titer-yield-productivity analysis for the fermentation performance space (oxalic.run_TRY_analysis).

Note that results used in the manuscript [1]_ were generated using biosteam==2.46.0,
thermosteam==0.44.0, contourplots==0.3.4, numpy==1.26.4, and dependencies (`commit 007cebb <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/Bioindustrial-Park/commit/007cebb2343a2189bbb9347913c90917c68c2e2c>`_).

To reproduce the results, directly run the script of interest, and results will
be saved as Excel files and figures in analyses/results.
