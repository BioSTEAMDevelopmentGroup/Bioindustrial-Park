LAOs: Production of Linear-Alpha Olefins from Renewable Fatty Alcohols
======================================================================

.. figure:: ./images/LAOs_areas.png

The biorefinery design for the production of linear-alpha olefins (LAOs)
follows all assumptions from a study by McClelland et. al. [1]_. A mixture of 
glucose, growth nutrients, water, and tridecane is mixed and fed to 
fermentation. The fermenter effluent is sent to a 3-phase decanter centrifuge 
to separate the oil, aqueous, and cell mass fractions. The cell mass is 
partially recycled to the fermenter, the oil fraction is sent to dehydration, 
and the aqueous fraction is sent to the separation to recover fatty alcohols by 
liquid-liquid extraction. The effluent of the dehydration section sent to the 
separation section to recover the LAOs by distillation. OSBL unit operations 
include storage, a cooling tower, a chilled water package, and heat and power 
cogeneration.

Getting Started
---------------

To load the biorefinery, simply import it. All data and variables
are lazy loaded by the module:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from biorefineries import LAOs as laos
    >>> # This is optional; it forces the biorefinery to load
    >>> # Otherwise, first time accessing will take a bit to load.
    >>> laos.load()
    >>> laos.chemicals # All chemicals used by the biorefinery.
