# HP: 3-Hydroxypropionic acid biorefineries

This module contains biorefinery configurations for the production of 
acrylic acid and sodium 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP salt) via biologically produced 
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) as discussed in [[1]](#1) and [[2]](#2).

Getting Started
---------------

Biorefineries can be loaded in the configurations detailed below
(baseline values and parameter distributions for all uncertain parameters are detailed and labeled in [.analyses/full/parameter_distributions](https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/Bioindustrial-Park/tree/master/biorefineries/HP/analyses/full/parameter_distributions)):

```
feedstock ∈ ['dextrose monohydrate', 'corn', 'sugarcane', 'corn stover']

product ∈ ['3-HP salt', 'acrylic acid']

fermentation_performance ∈ ['DASbox', '10 L', '300 L']
```


Any combination of the available choices for feedstock, product, and fermentation_performance may be loaded.
For example, for corn stover biorefineries with acrylic acid produced via 3-HP under fermentation
performance assumptions corresponding to those achieved in a 10-L bioreactor:

```python
>>> from biorefineries import HP
>>> HP.load_model(feedstock='corn stover', product='acrylic acid', fermentation_performance='10 L')
>>> HP.system.show(data=False) # Full system
System: HP_sys
Highest convergence error among components in recycle
stream M503-0 after 1 loops:
- flow rate   6.76e+00 kmol/hr (0.049%)
- temperature 5.65e-04 K (0.00019%)

To reproduce results reported in [[2]](#2), simply do the following:

(i) Clone the Bioindustrial-Park repository [commit 94edb3164e01641da1cf62bca8da495d4f8b4d99](https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/Bioindustrial-Park/tree/94edb3164e01641da1cf62bca8da495d4f8b4d99/biorefineries/HP) and add the 'bioindustrial-park' folder to your PYTHONPATH.

(ii) Clone the BioSTEAM repository [commit e2d3942dd1076a4516efc91ae194f9e558428551](https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam/tree/e2d3942dd1076a4516efc91ae194f9e558428551)
and add the 'biosteam' folder to your PYTHONPATH.

(iii) Navigate to your local filepath bioindustrial-park/biorefineries/HP
     in your command prompt, and use:
