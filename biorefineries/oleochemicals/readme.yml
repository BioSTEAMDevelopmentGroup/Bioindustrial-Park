## Oleochemicals Biorefinery

The **oleochemicals biorefinery** is available within the [BioIndustrial-Park](https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/Bioindustrial-Park) repository, which hosts complete biorefinery models and results generated with [BioSTEAM](https://biosteam.readthedocs.io). 
All biorefineries are located in the `biorefineries` package, distributed as an installable package for use with BioSTEAM.
The biorefinery contains several modules, each with a designated purpose (see Table S13 of the manuscript).
