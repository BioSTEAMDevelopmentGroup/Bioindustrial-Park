# The biorefinery named oleochemicals is available within BioIndustrial-Park which is a repository for
 # complete biorefinery models and results generated with BioSTEAM. 
 # All biorefinery models are in the biorefineries package, as an installable package for
  # complete biorefinery models in BioSTEAM.
# 1) The oleochemicals biorefinery was designed using BioSTEAM (version 2.83.3) and ThermoSTEAM (version 0.38.2). 
# 1) pip install biosteam version == 2.83.3
# 2) pip install thermosteam version == 0.38.2
# 3) $ git clone version 3 manuscript · BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/Bioindustrial-Park@74b66dc · GitHub 
# 2) The biorefinery contains several modules each with a designated purpose described in Table S13. 
# 3) Please use the BioIndustrial Park repository to accessing the following data
# 1) To access the samples and results for all the uncertainty analysis
# 2) To access the sensitivity analysis results please use the folder
# 3) To access the uncertainty analysis results for varying IRR [%]
# 4) To access the results for MSPs at different feedstock compositions
# 5) To access the files for MSPs at varying TAG [%]
