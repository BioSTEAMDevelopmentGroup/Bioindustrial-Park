The biorefinery named oleochemicals is available within BioIndustrial-Park which is a repository for 
complete biorefinery models and results generated with BioSTEAM. 
All biorefinery models are in the biorefineries package, as an installable package for complete biorefinery models in BioSTEAM.
The biorefinery contains several modules each with a designated purpose described in Table S13 in supporting Information 1. 
The oleochemicals biorefinery can be downloaded using the below steps
  1) pip install biosteam == 2.83.3
  2) pip install thermosteam == 0.38.2
  3) git clone https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/Bioindustrial-Park.git
  4) cd Bioindustrial-Park
  5) git checkout ba2cdd640bbe239afd2243c84c5332314d54312d

Please use the supporting information provided with the manuscript to acess the below results
1) To access the samples and results for all uncertainty and sensitivity analyses
2) To access the uncertainty analysis results for varying IRR (%)
3) To access the results for MSPs at different feedstock compositions
4) To access the files containing MSPs at varying TAG (%)

To run the biorefinery and perform simulations, please use the guidance provided in the tutorials in https://biosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
