# The biorefinery named oleochemicals is available within BioIndustrial-Park which is a repository for
# complete biorefinery models and results generated with BioSTEAM. 

# The oleochemicals biorefinery was designed using BioSTEAM (version 2.83.3) and ThermoSTEAM (version 0.38.2). 
# 1) pip install biosteam version == 2.83.3
# 2) pip install thermosteam version == 0.38.2
# 3) $ git clone version 3 manuscript · BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/Bioindustrial-Park@74b66dc · GitHub 

# The biorefinery contains several modules each with a designated purpose described in Table S13 in the Supplementary Information - A provided with the Manuscript.
#-Please use the BioIndustrial Park repository to accessing the following data available in the folders.
#-Samples and results for all the uncertainty analysis under folder name uncertainty_and_sensitivity_analysis_2000
#-Results for sensitivity analysis under folder name uncertainty_and_sensitivity_analysis_2000
#-To access uncertainty analysis results for varying IRR [%] under folder name MSP_vs_IRR_data
#-To access results for MSPs at different feedstock compositions and feedstock flow under folder name feedstock_flow_versus_MSP
