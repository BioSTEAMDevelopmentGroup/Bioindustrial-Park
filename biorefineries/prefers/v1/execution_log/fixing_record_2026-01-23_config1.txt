_config1.py – Fixing Record (2026-01-23)

Goal
- Verify that _config1.py runs successfully after refactoring:
  - Renamed U504→U502, M502→M501, H502→H501 in Area 500
  - Renamed M501→M901, S501→S901 in Area 900
  - Replaced Diafiltration with Filtration.from_preset('UF')

Key Fixes Applied
1) Unit Renaming in Area 500
   - Renamed M502→M501, H502→H501 for sequential numbering starting from x01
   - Renamed U504→U502 for sequential numbering

2) Unit Renaming in Area 900
   - Renamed M501→M901, S501→S901 to avoid conflict with Area 500 units
   - Area 900 now uses 9xx numbering convention

3) Attempted Diafiltration→Filtration switch (reverted)
   - Tried using Filtration.from_preset('UF') but Filtration class is RDVF for solids
   - Reverted to Diafiltration.from_preset('UF') which is correct for protein concentration

Run Configuration Observed
- Python: C:\Users\owenp\.conda\envs\BioSTEAMML\python.exe
- Script: c:\Programming\PREFERS\Bioindustrial-Park\biorefineries\prefers\v1\LegHb\system\_config1.py

Outcome
- [SUCCESS] Full execution completed after 3 iterations.

Generated Outputs
- System diagram HTML generated

Terminal Output (summary)
- All specifications met!
- Production Rate: 275.00 kg/hr
- Leghemoglobin Content: 7.43%
- Protein Purity: 82.51%
- Annual Production: 2200.00 metric tons/year

Notes
- This is part of a larger refactoring task affecting both config1 and config2
- Filtration class (RDVF) is NOT appropriate for protein concentration - use Diafiltration
- User's intent to avoid Diafiltration may need clarification
